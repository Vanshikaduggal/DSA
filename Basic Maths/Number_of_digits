This question is from GFG platform :
In this question you have to divide by each digit present in the number . If the number is divisible by the digit than return count of that digit.

class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to count the number of digits in n that evenly divide n
    int evenlyDivides(int n) {
        // code here
        int count=0;
        string str= to_string(n);
        for(char c:str)
        {
            int digit=c-'0';
            if(digit !=0 && n%digit==0)
            {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
